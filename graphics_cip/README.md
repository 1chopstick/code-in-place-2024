# README

Updated the CS106A graphics library to include missing Code in Place functions, allowing your CIP assignments to be run in your local IDE such as Visual Studio Code. Changes to the original file are marked with [CIP] in comments.

You need to add `canvas.update()` to your code to update the canvas after making changes.

Should also put this function call at the end of your `main()` method to prevent the graphics window from automatically closing when your python program terminates.

```
    # wait for the user to close the window
    canvas.mainloop()    
```
